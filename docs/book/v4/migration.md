# Migration

This document covers changes between version 3 and version 4, and how you may
update your code to adapt to them.

## SwooleRequestHandlerRunner

Version 3 pinned to the version 1 series of [laminas/laminas-httphandlerrunner](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-httphandlerrunner/), which defined the class `Laminas\HttpHandlerRunner\RequestHandlerRunner`.
mezzio-swoole extended that class via its own implementation `Mezzio\Swoole\SwooleRequestHandlerRunner`.

Version 4 of mezzio-swoole pins to version 2 of laminas/laminas-httphandlerrunner.
laminas-httphandlerrunner v2 introduces `Laminas\HttpHandlerRunner\RequestHandlerInterface`, and has its `Laminas\HttpHandlerRunner\RequestHandlerRunner` class implement this new interface; additionally, the class now marks itself **final**, which prevents extension, and thus requires a change in mezzio-swoole's implementation.

Additionally, the base [Mezzio package](https://docs.mezzio.dev/mezzio/) adopted laminas-httphandlerrunner v2.1 as its minimum supported version starting with its 3.8.0 release, and modified its `Mezzio\Application` class constructor to typehint against `Laminas\HttpHandlerRunner\RequestHandlerInterface` instead of `Laminas\HttpHandlerRunner\RequestHandlerRunner`.
The result is that mezzio-swoole v3 releases cannot be used with Mezzio versions 3.8 and newer.

For version 4, `Mezzio\Swoole\SwooleRequestHandlerRunner` now implements `Laminas\HttpHandlerRunner\RequestHandlerInterface`, but **does not** extend `Laminas\HttpHandlerRunner\RequestHandlerRunner` (as it cannot).
Further, the class is now marked **final**.

As such, you can no longer extend `Mezzio\Swoole\SwooleRequestHandlerRunner`.
To change behavior of the class, we recommend using its [event system](events.md) and attaching listeners to shape its behavior.

## ServerRequestSwooleFactory

INFO: Since 4.3.0

Starting in version 4.3.0, the behavior of `Mezzio\Swoole\ServerRequestSwooleFactory` changes slightly with regards to how it handles the various `X-Forwarded-*` headers.
These headers are conventionally used when a server is behind a load balancer or reverse proxy in order to present to the application the URL that initiated a request.
Starting in version 4.3.0, by default, these headers are only honored if the request received originates from a reserved subnet (e.g., localhost; class A, B, and C subnets; IPv6 private and local-link subnets).

If you want to honor these headers from any source, or if you never want to allow them, you can provide an alternate implementation via the `Laminas\Diactoros\ServerRequestFilter\FilterServerRequestInterface` service.
As an example, you could use the following to dis-allow them:

```php
return [
    'dependencies' => [
        'invokables' => [
            \Laminas\Diactoros\ServerRequestFilter\FilterServerRequestInterface::class =>
                \Laminas\Diactoros\ServerRequestFilter\DoNotFilter::class,
        ],
    ],
];
```

If you are using Mezzio 3.11.0 or later, you can also use its `Mezzio\Container\FilterUsingXForwardedHeadersFactory` and related configuration to fine-tune which sources may be considered for usage of these headers.

## Support for OpenSwoole 22.0.x

INFO: Since 4.10.0 mezzio-swoole supports the use of openswoole PHP extension version 22.0 and later.

If your application has custom code that re-implements the function `swoole_set_process_name` then make sure to remove it.
This package will take care of the compatibility issues.
